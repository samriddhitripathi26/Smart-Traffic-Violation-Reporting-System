Welcome to the Smart Traffic Violation Reporting System Project! 🚦🚗

This project leverages YOLOv10 for real-time vehicle detection and classification, dynamically adjusting traffic light timings to optimize flow and reduce congestion. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or traffic enthusiast, this system provides an innovative approach to managing traffic efficiently.

Dynamic-Traffic-Control-YOLOv10
This project implements a dynamic traffic control system using the YOLOv10 model for real-time vehicle detection and classification. The system optimizes traffic light timings based on current traffic conditions, enhancing traffic flow and reducing congestion.

🚀 Features
Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv10.
Dynamic traffic signal adjustment based on detected vehicle types.
Improved traffic management to reduce congestion and enhance emergency response.

🛠 Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: opencv-python, numpy, ultralytics, cvzone

📈 Usage
Ensure you have set the correct video path in both Create Zones.py and main.py.
Run the project to see the dynamic traffic control system in action.

🐞 Troubleshooting
Model Loading / Missing Dependency Errors:
Ensure all required libraries are installed.
Verify that yolov10n.pt is correctly placed in the project directory.
Upgrade the ultralytics library if necessary.
✅ Experience real-time dynamic traffic control powered by YOLOv10!
